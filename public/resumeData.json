I am a complete homebody and introvert that loves reading, creating, and occasionally binge-watching the latest and greatest TV shows. In 2015, I graduated from Boise State University with dual Bachelor of Science degrees in Psychology and Criminal Justice. In 2016, I moved to Utah and in 2018, earned my Master of Science degree in Quantitative Psychology from Utah State University. Shortly after graduating, I began working for the Utah Department Department of Human Services as a Research Consultant for the Division of Juvenile Justice Services. In 2020, I chose to develop my deep passion for data science and programming further by becaming a full-stack web developer.",
